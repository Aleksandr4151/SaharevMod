A mod created for stashunters and regular players to simplify the game on 2b2t (you can use it on other servers as well). This mod is not yet a cheat client, so no one will see your advantages without an anti-cheat.
At the moment, there are 2 modules in the modification that are interconnected by one item - elytras.

The first one is ElytraSwapper. He repairs elytras on the creeper farm. By pressing the key you've assigned, the character will equip a broken elytra, start jumping every five seconds, and if it's repaired, equip the next broken elytra. This will continue until all the elytras are repaired.

Usually, the module is bound to the "V" key, but you can change it by entering the command provided below

This mod will be improved. In the future, many modules will be added, as well as a HUD. It is possible that this modification will be combined with MeteorClient
Stay tuned for updates and happy using :)
